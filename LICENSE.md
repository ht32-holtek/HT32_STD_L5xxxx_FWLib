For the avoidance of doubt, such restricted licenses include, without limitation, the GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), and similar copyleft licenses.

8.0	Miscellaneous

8.1	No rights are granted under any HOLTEK patents or other intellectual property rights except as explicitly provided herein.
